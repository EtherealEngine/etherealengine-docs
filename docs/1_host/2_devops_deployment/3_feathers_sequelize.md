## OpenAPI
Our server is set up with Swagger documentation to automatically generate from most endpoints. A few custom routes are not documented at this time, but most of the basic stuff is.

You can see the docs for a running Ethereal Engine instance locally at:

Or on our [dev cluster](https://api-dev.etherealengine.com/openapi)
