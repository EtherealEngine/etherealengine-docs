# Writing Style
**TODO**

## Avoid Long Paragraphs
Avoid really long paragraphs at all costs.  
Long paragraphs are extremely hard to follow, specially when they are giving multiple distinct and separate instructions that could be broken down into more readable paragraphs instead.  
They should be used with intention, and not out of "simplicity" or "low effort".  
Use long paragraphs only when they really do improve the quality of the learning process, and not just because the content grew into them.

## Fix Grammatical Errors
Typos and grammatical errors should be fixed before requesting a review.  
Please do a grammar correction pass before sending your PR. Specially if you are submitting a lot of text/content.  
Ask for help if you still need help finding grammar and syntax errors after you do a first correction pass on your content.

## Concise Titles
Do not use long and detailed titles.  
Use short and concise text just to identify the section and nothing more.  

## Accurate Titles
Titles will be the main reference used by the user for navigation with the `Sidebar` and `Table of Contents`.  
As such, all pages are required to have good titles that accurately represent the contents of their respective section.

Titles are extremely crucial for SEO performance. Please pay extra attention to their content.   
They will become part of the `sitemap.xml` file used by web crawlers to understand and navigate the website.
