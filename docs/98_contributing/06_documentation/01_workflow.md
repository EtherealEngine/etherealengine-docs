# Submit Workflow
The repository that holds this website uses the PR workflow exclusively.  
You will be required to create a PR in order to submit your changes.  

This can be done very easily in just a few steps:
- Click on the `Edit this Page` link at the bottom of the page you want to edit.
- Click on the `Edit this file` button on the GitHub page that was opened.
- Write your changes to the file.
- Click on `Commit Changes`.
- GitHub will now open a window where you can give your commit a message, a description, and assign a name to your branch.
- Click on `Propose changes` and your PR will be submitted for review.

:::note
Please give your branch an identifiable name for easier review and identification of your changes.  
You should also describe your changes in the `Commit message`.  
Giving an `Extended description` to your commit is not required, but very desirable when it would make sense to have one.
