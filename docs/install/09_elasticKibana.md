# Setup Elastic Search & Kibana

Elastic Search and Kibana will be automatically launched with `npm run dev` and will be running on `localhost` ports `9200` & `5601` respectively. This will automatically set up and run Redis/MariaDB docker containers, and Ethereal Engine client/server/instance-server instances.
