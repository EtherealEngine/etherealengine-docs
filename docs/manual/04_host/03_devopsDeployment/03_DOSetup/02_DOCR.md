# Create DOCR for build images
To create a ditial ocean container registry, on the [DO Website](https://cloud.digitalocean.com), in the left nav bar, you could click on the `Container Registry` and then create a new Container Registry. You can name it as you like but the convention that we have been following will be `etherealengine`. This container registry will be used to store the Ethereal Engine specific docker images. You can get the DOCR URL from the created container registry which should look something similar to `registry.digitalocean.com/etherealengine` and would be used in the code to push images to DOCR. 
Along with the DOCR URL, to communicate to the DOCR, you would need to create an API token which can then be used inside the code. To create the token, go to API -> Tokens > Create New Token, give the token a meaningful name and set the expiry, also give the token the required rights. For DOCR, you will have to give it full Read & Write permissions. Once created, you could save this token and use it in the code. 

:::Note: Unlike the AWS ECR, we do not need to explicitly create the repositories for different categories of images, when a request is sent to DOCR with the repository name, it checks if the repository exists, otherwise it creates the repository on the run time.
