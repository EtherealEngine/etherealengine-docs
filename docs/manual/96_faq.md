# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is it free to use?
Ethereal is a general purpose engine and platform that can be used by creators to provide access to fully customizable experiences.

The engine itself is open source, under a `CPAL` license. Anyone can host Ethereal Engine for free in their own device.

It is up to each creator to decide if the services they provide should be paid or free, and who has access to the experiences and services they provide.
Examples:
- Free access to virtual online shop, but buying items in its stores would be paid
- A VR book club community with weekly meetings that is completely free for everyone
- A videogame that is provided as a "pay once" experience
- A free-to-play videogame that anyone can play on their phone.

## Do I need a powerful computer?
Performance on each individual device will depend on its hardware and how each individual experience was created. Some experiences will require more resources than others.  
But in all cases, Ethereal Engine will automatically adapt to your device to ensure a good balance between quality and performance.

## What devices do I need to use?
Ethereal Engine is built to be compatible across all devices including desktop, mobile, tablet, VR, and AR devices.

## The world is not loading, what do I do?
Try turning off ad blocker, and make sure your browser is up to date.

## What is the maximum concurrent users?
The maximum concurrent users depends on the complexity and fidelity of your environment and avatars. Ethereal Engine can support up to several thousand users with scaled avatars, or just a dozen for a high-definition intimate experience.
