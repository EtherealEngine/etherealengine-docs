## Participate in the community
The easiest way to get involved is to participate in Ethereal Engine's community.  
Join us on your favorite [community channel](../99_community/00_intro.md) and become a part of the conversation.  
Ask any questions that you may have and/or help other users with their questions.

## Create and Host your own worlds
Ethereal Engine is a platform aimed at helping you achieve your goals.
And nothing showcases a great tool better than some great projects made with it!

Complete the [Getting Started](../01_gettingStarted/00_intro.md) tutorials, learn to use the engine with the [Ethereal Engine Manuals](/docs/category/manual), create a cool project that you love and then share it with the world.

## Promote Ethereal Engine
Talk about the engine with people you know. Let them know about those cool projects that you have created, or those locations that you like the most. Being a user and overall advocate of Ethereal Engine is a great way to help growing the community.

## Contribute to Ethereal Engine's development
Ethereal Engine is an open-source project, based on the [CPAL](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine/blob/dev/LICENSE) license.
You can find the source code of the engine on Ethereal Engine's [GitHub](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine) repository, and some guidelines on how to contribute to its codebase in the [Contributing](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine#contributing) section of the repository's readme.

## Testing and reporting issues
Our team is constantly on the lookout for potential issues during development, and we have a really high standard for Code Reviewing and QA _(Quality Assurance)_. But sometimes bugs can go unnoticed and sneak into release versions of the codebase.
Because of this, another great way to contribute is by reporting errors, problems or issues that may show up in different versions of Ethereal Engine.

Search for the issue in our [Issues List](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine/issues), and open a new one if you think that what you found has not been reported yet.

## Contribute to Ethereal Engine's documentation
Documentation tasks are a great way to get started if you are new to the engine and/or development in general.  

If you are comfortable with code, the engine uses `JSDoc` and `TypeDoc` for generating its [API documentation](https://etherealengine.github.io/etherealengine-docs/typedoc), which is generated form the source code of the main Ethereal Engine's [source code repository](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine).  

For an easier task, the documentation website you are reading right now is maintained from its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine-docs). Find something that you think could be improved in this website, and either open an issue or send a PR with your proposed changes.

Get started by reading the [Get Involved: Documentation Guidelines](/contributing/documentation/intro).
