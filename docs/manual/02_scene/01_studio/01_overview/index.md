# Studio Overview

Navigating to the `/studio` route in any Ethereal Engine deployment will show you the projects page, where you can open existing projects or create a new one.  
> _eg: When the engine is hosted at `dev.etherealengine.com`, the studio would be accessed from `dev.etherealengine.com/studio`_

Opening a project will open the editor, from which you can then load any scenes contained in your project.

Each scene consists of a list of **Components** which are the various features, templates & prefabs that you would normally expect in a scene studio _(such as models, colliders, audio, etc)_.  
A wide range of other integrations are also supported _(eg: portals to let you traverse between worlds)_.

Scenes can be saved by pressing `Ctrl+S` in your keyboard, or by navigating to the save option in the Hamburger menu located at the top-left of the editor's screen.
