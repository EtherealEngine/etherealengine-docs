# Channels
The Channels page provides list of the active text/audio/video channels available in an Ethereal Engine deployment.

Ethereal Engine channels are very similar in concept to Discord channels.  
They allow for communication between the users of a deployment via text, audio or video chat.

- **ID**: Unique ID of the Channel.
- **Name**: Human-readable name of the Channel.
- **Action**:  
  - **View**: Opens a dialog to edit the name of the target Channel.  
  - **Delete**: Orders the deployment to delete the target Channel _(no undoing possible)_.
