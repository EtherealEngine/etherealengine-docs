# Notification Service
## Set up Simple Notification Service (optional)

If you want to enable text message-based magiclink login, you will need to set up Simple Notification Service (SNS).

In the AWS web client, go to SNS -> Topics and Create a new topic.
Give it a name, and selected 'Standard' as the type, then click Create Topic.
