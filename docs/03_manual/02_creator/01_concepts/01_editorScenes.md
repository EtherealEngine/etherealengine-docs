# Scene Studio

Navigating to `/studio` will show you the projects page, where you can open existing projects or create a new one.

Opening a project will route you to `/studio/<projectName>` where the project studio will load. From here, you can open a scene, which will route you again to `/studio/<projectName>/<sceneName>`

The scene consists of a list of 'nodes' which act as templates / prefabs. These are what you would normally expect in a scene studio, such as models, colliders and audio, but we also support a wide range of integrations, such as shopify, wordpress and even portals to let you traverse between worlds.

To save a scene with Ctrl+S or in the top left Hamburger menu.
