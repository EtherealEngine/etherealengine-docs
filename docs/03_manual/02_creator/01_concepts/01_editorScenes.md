# Scene Studio

Navigating to `/studio` will show you the projects page, where you can open existing projects or create a new one.

Opening a project will open the editor, from which a scene can be loaded.

The scene consists of a list of 'components' which are the various features, templates & prefabs. These are what you would normally expect in a scene studio, such as models, colliders and audio, but a wide range of integrations are supported such as portals to let you traverse between worlds.

To save a scene with Ctrl+S or in the top left Hamburger menu.
