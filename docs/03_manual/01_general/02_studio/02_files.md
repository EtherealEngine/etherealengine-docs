# 2. Scene and Files Directory
<StudioOverview />

## Project Files
Contains all files associated with your project.
.json files and various other file types in this menu are your project files and will show up automatically when you create a new scene.

## Assets folder
Contains all assets you can import into your scene. When you use the Toolbar: File Menu to import files, they are delivered directly to the assets folder. To populate your scene simply drag them from the assets directly to your hierarchy.
Tip: Import may create a transform offset
When some assets are loaded they automatically show up in the scene in the hierarchy and sometimes at an offset. Simply delete them from the hierarchy and re-drag them from your assets folder into your scene hierarchy to have them be set at home (0,0,0)
