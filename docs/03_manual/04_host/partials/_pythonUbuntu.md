## Install Python 3
If Python 3 (`pip3 --version`) is not already installed on your device, you can do so by running following commands from your Ubuntu terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
```
You can verify that Python3 is installed correctly with the command: `python3 --version`.
