## Install Make
If Make (`make --version`) is not already installed on your device, you can do so by running following commands from your Ubuntu terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```
You can verify that Make is installed correctly with the command: `make --version`
