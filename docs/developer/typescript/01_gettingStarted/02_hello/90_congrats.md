# Congratulations!
You have just learned the minimal basics of working with Ethereal Engine using Typescript!  

This was a very minimal introductory tutorial to get you started really quickly.  
But Ethereal Engine has a lot more features to explore!

## What's Next?
#### Beginner
If this is your first time using Ethereal Engine, we have prepared an `Etheral Engine Basics` tutorial for you.  
It will teach you how to start expanding your knowledge of the engine without getting overwhelmed by its complexity.  
Go to the bottom of this page, and click on "Next" to continue with your learning journey!

#### Intermediate
If you are feeling confident already, you could jump right into the intermediate tutorials.  
Just pick a topic that interests you in the sidebar and continue your journey from there.  
:::note
Make sure to skim-read the basics section at least once, as it gives an overview of some important concepts that will be used all throughout the other guides.

#### Advanced
The [Manual](/manual) is where Ethereal Engine is presented in all of its complexity, without any guard-rails or hand-holding.  
You will also find the [Reference API](/typedoc) really useful when writing the code of your application.
