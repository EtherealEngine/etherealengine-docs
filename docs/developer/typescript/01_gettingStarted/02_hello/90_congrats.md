## What's Next?
#### Beginner
If this is your first time using Ethereal Engine, we have prepared an [Ethereal Engine Basics](/developer/typescript/basics) tutorial for you.  
It will teach you how to start expanding your knowledge of the engine without getting overwhelmed by its complexity.

#### Intermediate
If you are feeling confident already, you could jump right into the intermediate tutorials.  
Just pick a topic that interests you in the sidebar and continue your journey from there.  
:::note[Intermediate Note]
Make sure to skim-read the basics section at least once, as it gives an overview of some important concepts that will be used all throughout the other guides.

#### Advanced
The [Manual](/manual) is where Ethereal Engine is presented in all of its complexity, without any guard-rails or hand-holding.  
You will also find the [Reference API](https://etherealengine.github.io/etherealengine-docs/api) really useful when writing the code of your application.
