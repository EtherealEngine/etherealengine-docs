# Quick Recap
In the last step of the [Hello World Tutorial](../gettingStarted/hello/component#creating-a-custom-component) we created a custom Scene Component .  
But we never really explained how we did it.

We also skimmed over multiple concepts that are very important for working with the Engine. So lets start on the right foot and explain them now.  
Also, now that we are into it, we are going to style our code in a way that matches Ethereal Engine's code a bit more.
