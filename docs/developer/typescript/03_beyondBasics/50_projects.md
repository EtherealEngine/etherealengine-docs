## Project Configuration

TODO: Technical Explanation about xrengine.config.ts

Sketch:
As you can see, we are declaring a function that will `import` our `./src/Hello.ts` file.  
The engine will call this function when our project is loaded, and our file is declaring an `export default async function`.  
Loading the configuration file will call its `worldInjection` function, which will in turn import our file,  
and therefore let the engine know about the `worldInjection` function that we have declared in our code.
