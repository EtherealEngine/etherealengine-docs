# Introduction
<!--
TODO: This page should contain:
- Small introduction to the Developer guides
- Explanation of Nocode-vs-Typescript: 
  No-Code: Segue into the Behave Graph Section of the Developer Manual
  Typescript: Segue into the Developer Manual
-->
_This page will contain an introduction to the Getting Started: Developer guides._  

_Programming in Ethereal Engine can be done through [Typescript](/docs/manual/developer/typescript/intro)._
_But the engine also has a NoCode alternative to programming, called [Behave Graph](/docs/manual/developer/behaveGraph/intro)._
