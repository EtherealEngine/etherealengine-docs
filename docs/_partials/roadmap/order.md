:::warning
**Reading Order Matters**:  
This list of concepts is layed out in the order that they should be learned.  

Most Concepts will build on knowledge acquired previously from other Concepts earlier in the roadmap.
If you get stuck understanding a concept, or how to use it, the next concepts in the list might be difficult to follow.  
:::

:::tip
That said, don't let reading order stop your progress.  
Just make sure to come back and revisit Concepts earlier in the list if you get stuck somewhere further down the road.
