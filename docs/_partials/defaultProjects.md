Ethereal Engine has a few scenes that are installed by default.  
With the engine running, open the Studio by navigating to https://localhost:3000/studio, and you will see the engine's default project listed in that page.  

Lets give it a test run:
- Open the default project by clicking on its card
- Click on one of the scenes to open it
- Click on the `Play` button to enter the scene with an Avatar
- Move around the scene with `WASD` and/or clicking on the ground
