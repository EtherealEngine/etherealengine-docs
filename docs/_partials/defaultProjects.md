Ethereal Engine has a few projects that are installed by default.  
With the engine running, open the Studio by navigating to https://localhost:3000/studio, and you will see the engine's default projects listed in that page.  

Lets give them a test run:
- Open one of the default projects by clicking on its card
- Click on the `Play` button to enter the scene with an Avatar
- Move around the scene with `WASD` and/or clicking on the ground
