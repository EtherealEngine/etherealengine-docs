Our team is constantly on the lookout for potential issues during development, and we have a really high standard for Code Reviewing and QA _(Quality Assurance)_. But sometimes bugs can go unnoticed and sneak into release versions of the codebase.
Because of this, another great way to contribute is by reporting errors, problems or issues that may show up in different versions of Ethereal Engine.

Search for the issue in our [Issues List](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine/issues), and open a new one if you think that what you found has not been reported yet.
