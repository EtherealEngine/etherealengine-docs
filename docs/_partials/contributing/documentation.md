Documentation tasks are a great way to get started if you are new to the engine and/or development in general.  

If you are comfortable with code, the engine uses `JSDoc` and `TypeDoc` for generating its [API documentation](https://etherealengine.github.io/etherealengine-docs/typedoc), which is generated form the source code of the main Ethereal Engine's [source code repository](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine).  

For an easier task, the documentation website you are reading right now is maintained from its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EtherealEngine/etherealengine-docs). Find something that you think could be improved in this website, and either open an issue or send a PR with your proposed changes.

Get started by reading the [Get Involved: Documentation Guidelines](/manual/contributing/documentation).
